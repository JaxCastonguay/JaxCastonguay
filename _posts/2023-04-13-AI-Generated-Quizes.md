# 🎉 Crispy Quiz

[**Crispy Quiz**](https://crispyquiz.com) creates article/content-specific quizzes to test knowledge retention and comprehension.

## 🚀 Inception

This project was initially designed to help test my Spanish comprehension on articles I had just read. Upon hearing how much ChatGPT was disrupting education and teachers' ability to accurately assess their students, I realized my project could be used to turn the tides in teachers' favor. Now, teachers can quiz their students on specific materials to ensure they're completing their assignments and understanding them properly.
