					<h3>No Monthly Hosting Fee</h3>
				</header>
				<p>You read that right. Not only do the build-your-own-site companies make you do all the work yourself - but they even make you pay just to keep it accessable.
				<br><br>That means you'll save almost $300 EVERY YEAR as compared to the do-it-yourself competitors.</p>

					<h3>Security And Reliability</h3>
				</header>
				<p>While I said I wouldn't over overwhelm you with vocab words, that SSL Certificate is important. I'll take measures to make sure your website is secure. It'll also be very reliable so that your customers can visit it any time.</p>
