					<h2>How I started</h2>
				</header>
				<p>My name is Jacques. I’ve been a full time developer since 2020. That <i>unique</i> situation gave me a lot of time to hone my skills. Even before that I was working as a developer while studying since 2017. I absolutely love projects. Nothing is more fun for me than starting with a vision, and seeing it through to the end and being able to say “I made this.”</p>
